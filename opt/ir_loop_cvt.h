/* Perform Loop Convertion.
Transform while-do loop to do-while loop.

e.g: Given loop I, the loop induction variable is i, loop upper bound is N.

while do loop is:
    bb1:
        if i > N, branch bb3;
    bb2:
        loop body;
        goto bb1;
    bb3:
        ...

after convertion:

    bb1:
        if i > N, branch bb3;
    bb2:
        loop body;
        if i <= N, branch bb2;
    bb3:
